                Exercising the intellect is just as vital as training the body. Cutting-edge neuroscience mixed with proprietary technology allows the Options group to produce customized action plans. And specific prescriptive counsel that comprehensively maximizes the function of an athlete’s brain. Applied neuroscience now allows us to measure, train, and upgrade the brain in the same way that elite athletes have for centuries measured, trained, and improved their performance ‘below the neck.’

            <h2>Virtual reality</h2>
            <img class="article-img" src="./images/virtual-reality.jpg" alt="virtual-reality" title="Virtual Reality" />
            <p class="article-paragraph">
                Virtual Reality (VR) is an interactive virtual environment that uses cameras, sensors, joysticks, or costumes to immerse you in a different world. Many clubs and international rugby teams are also using virtual reality headsets. It is used to produce simulated rugby scenarios such as line-outs, high balls, and first-phase attacks. This can help gamers improve their cognitive learning and visualisation skills. AR refers to a type of technology that lets you see additional objects or characters in the actual world.

            <h2>VAR – Video Assistant Referee</h2>
            <img class="article-img" src="./images/var.jpg" alt="var" title="VAR"/>
            <p class="article-paragraph">
                Before this, goal-line technology was introduced in football, which helped determine if the ball crossed the goal line or not. It was only used when the referee couldn’t rule a goal and to take a third opinion.
                Then later, VAR was first used in a friendly game between France and Italy, and after a promising experiment, a pitch-side monitor was used in the FIFA Club World Cup. The A-league was the first professional division to adopt VAR, with the MLS, Bundesliga, and Serie A succeeding the suit.
